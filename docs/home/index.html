Electronic Panopticism 
 
Panoptism which is the act of surveillance is prevalent within both pieces of media, Black Mirror uses this to their advantage by the series literal title. The title  translates to the "black mirror" you see on your electronics' screens when they’re turned off.  In this way it gives the audience ability to question themselves across any platform.  In an interview with the Guardian series Creator Charlie Brooker further explains his reasoning for naming the series: "Any TV, any LCD, any iPhone, any iPad—something like that—if you just stare at it, it looks like a black mirror, and there's something cold and horrifying about that.”  Panoptcism is a social theory created by Michel Foucault to explain the use of external surveillance in order to maintain control over individuals. For example a Panopticon is a circular building with an observation deck in the center, only part of the building can observe the surrounding area but it still maintains a sense of being watched. This is used mostly within a prison structure to ensure prisoners follow rules, the idea of being watched will make an individual want to follow the rules in fear of punishment.  In today’s society one doesn’t have to worry about the panopticon structure because of the views of hundreds of thousands from social media to the websites we visit all being tracked and watched all data being collected and accounted for.
